# This script is for testing the .yaml and .json file types for later use. it will also
# generate a generic config.yaml and data.json with default settings and readings for the sensor system. If a file
# exists it will erase the files, and rewrite them with default values to prevent errors. Essentially this script resets
# the entire sensor system to default. Like the others in this folder, this is a POC item mostly designed for later use
# to make the overall program easier ot write. This one however has the exception to being useful to UI, and over all
# program as it give reference ot the file types and dictionaries used on the sensor side.
# As per usual comment convention is to explain all functions and commands for later reuse, and the code is designed to
# be easy to follow and read. in other words, there is nothing fancy here by design.
